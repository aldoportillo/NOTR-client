                    <h3 className='orange-font'>Prohibition and the FDA</h3>
                    <p>In 1935, the Alcohol Administration Act (now the TTB) emerged, shaping the landscape of alcohol regulation post-Prohibition (1920-1935). Its primary goal was revenue generation, yet it also took charge of meticulous alcohol label oversight. A pivotal moment occurred in 1990, when the FDA mandated Nutrition Facts labels. However, alcohol's regulation by the TTB resulted in an exemption from this requirement. Solely displaying alcohol percentage became the norm. Efforts to introduce Nutrition Facts labels were made, such as by The Center for Science in the Public Interest. Yet, the TTB expressed concern that such labeling could misrepresent alcohol as nutritious. This narrative reflects the intricate interplay of regulations, health, and perception in alcohol labeling.</p>
